In a world where pretty much everyone is a social scientist (not a real profession), it shouldn't be surprising to have universal claims popping around everywhere, and with the increasing access to platforms like social media and growth of opinion-chambers, this might be our inevitable future where we have people coming up with universal/apparently-universal ideas everyday if not every second. The frightening part about this entire thing is less the opportunity provided---as most of it will cancel out owing to subpar research, clear presence of opinionated claims etc---but the sneaky proliferation of potentially biased yet legitimate looking ideas.

While I want to point names to fields and professions here, but I think most of us know what I am talking about.
