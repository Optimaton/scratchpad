# scratchpad

As the name suggests, this is a scratchpad that I use to satiate my hunger for trying out random things (mostly small snippets of code to understand a concept or try out an idea in mind).

## description
This repository contains all the random code snippets I have worked on/I am working on as part of learning or while having to work on a project.<br>
All well organized in a categories. If you wish to look at or use some of them, do it at your own risk :sweat_smile:.

Although all the code present in this repository are functional snippets of code, which you can copy and run but I don't know if this would  be of any value to anyone.
